// initialize Answer: generate random number btween 0 and 1, multiply by 1, convert to integer with round up

// initialize Turns variable, set to 1

// initialize Guess variable, set to 0

// initialize boolean variable Correct, set to value False

// Keep looping while Correct is false

    // prompt user for Guess, tell user what to input

    // check if guess is equal to answer

        // if equal, say "Correct" and number of turns
 
        // set Correct equal to true to get out of loop


    // check if guess greater than answer

        // give feedback: go lower

    // check if guess lower than answer

        // give feedback: go higher

    // add one to turns

// thank player for playing
